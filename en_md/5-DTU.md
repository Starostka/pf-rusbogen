## Lyngby campus

Lyngby Campus lies in Kongens Lyngby, situated on Anker Engelunds Vej 1, and is a large complex comprised of approximately 100 buildings and with a circumference of 5 km, bounded by a path. It can therefore be a bit of a task to find the right building, and right room. Luckily, the buildings and rooms are placed and numbered systematically, making it all a bit easier.

##### A coordinate system
Lyngby Campus is built like a coordinate system, with 4 quadrants. The quadrants are defined by Anker Engelunds Vej as the x-axis, and the avenues as the y-axis (see the map in the app), and is enumerated like any other coordinate system from 1- 4.

All buildings and rooms at Lyngby Campus are identified by a three-figure number, except for lecture halls which are identified with a two-figure number. The first figure in a buildings number identifies which quadrant a building belongs to, such as 343 belonging to the third quadrant. The second and third figure describes where the building is in the quadrant. The larger the figure, the further away from the intersection of Anker Engelunds Vej and Knuth-Winterfeldts Allé. For example, building 301 is very close to Origo, whereas building 378 is in the opposite corner of the third quadrant. The first  figure in a rooms number designates the floor it is on, so room 105 is on the first floor (note, Danes usually designates the ground floor as 0.).
