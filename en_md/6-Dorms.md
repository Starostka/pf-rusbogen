# 6 Dorms

Moving to a new place is always a challenge, and for most new students it can also be difficult to see where to find a place to live. Colleges are an opportunity here, and there are some colleges both on and around the Lyngby Campus and around the Ballerup Campus. In this chapter you can read more about these and find out if college life could be something for you.

## PKS

Polyteknisk KollegieSelskab amba, also known as PKS, is a non-profit company founded by a group of dormitories connected to DTU. The company is led by an unpaid board consisting of members who are elected among boardmembers from the dormitory boards and councilmembers from the dormitory councils, thus ensuring the dormitories great influence on how they are administered. PKS administers 8 dormitories on and around DTU Lyngby Campus, and the PKS administration office is located on the PF hall on the 1st floor in building 101E.

PKS offers 1,722 single rooms and 185 double rooms of which the majority is located within a radius of 5 km from DTU, Lyngby Campus. None of the rooms are furnished, the majority of the rooms have private bathrooms, and all of the rooms are connected to the internet. Rents for the single rooms vary from approximately 2,400.00 DKK to 3,700.00 DKK and the double rooms vary from 3,600.00 DKK to 7,200.00 DKK.

In order to be able to get a room, you must sign up at PKS’ website; www.pks.dk, where you have to fill out an application form. On the website you will be able to find answers to most questions.
