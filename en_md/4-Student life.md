# 4 Student life

##### The social life

DTU is so much more than a university. Whether you are looking for a board game club, a sports club, a place to play music, or other stuff like concerts, running events, or merely a place to get a cold beer after the last lecture Friday – we got it. Below you can find more information about where to go.

## S-Huset

Studenterhuset, or S-Huset, is one of PF’s most recognizable social offers. S-Huset has a variety of facilities connected to it; a café environment, seating areas and student bars.

S-Huset is always a good place to relax between lectures.

S-Huset has multiple cafés on DTU where you can buy a coffee, a sandwich or whatever you need to affordable prices. You can play pool or other games – basically it a place to hang out after courses.

Besides running the cafés, S-Huset is responsible for all of PF’s concerts, both the smaller Friday Rocks and larger concerts like “Joints” where the entire S-Hus is transformed into a concert hall. Latest we have hosted Specktors x Nonsens, Johnny Deluxe and Dúné. Volunteers of PF run the concerts. That includes the people who book the bands, the CREW, the bartenders, the guards and the wardrobe personal. All of them are students of DTU.

S-Huset don’t just host concerts, but also host events like Hangover Bingo, Pub Quiz, Comedy Night and larger sports events like Super Bowl or the Worldcup games. S-Huset rents out their facilities to events like Beerpong tournaments, Christmas Lunches known as “Julefrokost” (a Danish Christmas tradition), and much more. The facilities can be used for a lot of different things, and if you have any good ideas, just write to shusformand@pf.dk.

######  Where do I find S-Huset?

“Kaffestuen” is a café where you can buy food and drinks for affordable prices with even more discount if you are a PF-member. It is in “Kaffestuen” you can buy tickets for different S-Hus events. This is also where you can borrow things like board games, cues for pool, or bats for table tennis.

“Pejsestuen” is S-Huset’s lounge area. This is the place for the pool tables, foosball tables, and sofas where you can sit and enjoy your coffee, soda, or beer. From “Pejsestuen” you have the opportunity to go out to the S-Hus yard where there is a build-in beer-bowling field.

###### PF Café
On Lyngby Campus there is a small café in building 306 which has roughly the same products and the same prices as in S-Huset. The PF Café is strategically placed close to larger auditoriums to provide the necessary coffee for the needing people. The café is closed until the renovations of building 306 are done.

###### S-Huset Ballerup
S-Huset in Ballerup is a café, like ”Kaffestuen” and the PF Café, with approximately the same selection in both food and drinks. It is a nice place to hang out and reload for lectures with games and a PlayStation 4. A lot of students use S-Huset Ballerup to eat their lunch, meet up, or drink a beer.

###### Kælderbaren
”Kælderbaren” is located in the basement of building 101 underneath Pejsestuen. Here you will find a range of special beers, mostly from Danish microbreweries, a wide range of drinks, and an overall cozy atmosphere.

## Volunteer in S-Huset

S-Huset always needs new competent people both as bartenders, CREW, technicians, guards, or something entirely different. If you have an interest in planning and executing events, the S-Huset might be something for you.

CREW meets up every Friday during lunch break (at 12.15) in Kælderbaren. During these meetups, you can get information about the kind of work CREW does and about upcoming events. At the meeting there will also be cake, often homemade.

CREW takes care of a lot of things regarding the concerts like building the stages, be stage guards, and, in collaboration with PolyJoint Booking, make sure the artists are having a good time when they are both on and off stage. It is also possible to spot CREW behind the bar from time to time as bartenders. You have the opportunity to partake as much or as little as you can.

Meetings will be held throughout the semester. If you are interested, but unable to join them on Fridays, you are welcome to contact the CREW-chairmen Jens-Theodor and Lucas Gramme on mail crewformand@pf.dk
