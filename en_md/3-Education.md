##### Your education, the next year and where to get help

In the beginning it can be complicated to figure out the structure of your study program. In reality it’s quite simple, and you will adapt to the routine like everybody else. Until you find your way, we have made a description of the schematic structure, semester structure, the ECTS-point system and the courses. In addition, you will be able to read about where to seek help and get answers to your questions regarding your study program and your life as a student.

## Welcome to DTU

An engineering program with many opportunities

The engineering program is a full-time study program, and at DTU we emphasize on creating a flexible framework for your education. At DTU there are lots of opportunities to engage in which influence the direction of your education, for example through collaborations with companies, participating in student competitions, international exchange programs and innovating activities  such as at DTU Skylab. Use the opportunities there is on its way so you stand strong when you start your career as an engineer.

The flexible study year

DTU has a flexible study year which gives you man options when planning your studies. The study year consists of two 13-week-periods (spring and autumn) and four 3-week-periods in January, June, July, and August. The periods in July and August are offered as summer university, and can be used for study immersion or to sign up for courses with activities outside the usual settings of campus.

A world-class study environment

DTU focuses on the well being of the students, an attractive life on campus, and a good learning environment. As a student, you have many opportunities to directly influence the student environment at DTU.

DTU has a student environment fund (“This-for-that” fund, or in Danish “Noget- for-noget fonden”). You can apply for money from the fund if you have a great idea to improve the environment on campus or if you have an idea for new facilities.

Every year, DTU students can nominate their teacher for the Teacher of the Year Award which is handed out by PF. The price is founded to focus on the quality of education and to focus on teachers who are particularly passionate about their courses.

## Structure

###### The academic year
The academic year at DTU consists of  two semesters: a fall and a spring semester. Each semester begins with a 13-week-period followed by an exam period, and ends with a 3-week-period followed by yet another examperiod.

During the 13-week-period, you will typically have 3-6 courses, depending on the size of the courses. The 13-week-period starts on the Monday closest to September 1st and February 1st respectively.

Exam periods last approximately 3 weeks (including study period) and are held in December, May, and August. The placement of the examinations is determined by which schematic module the course was in and therefore it is already known at the course admission.

3-week-periods are course periods that start immediately after the exams for the 13-week-courses, and they are in January and June. DTU offers “summer university”, with the option of 3-week-courses in July and August. Registration deadlines, start and end dates for the individual periods can be found here.

###### Vacations and holidays
The summer holiday lasts approx. 9-10 weeks. The autumn holiday is held in week 42, while the winter holiday is held in week 4 or 5 depending on the 3-week-period in January and the start of the semester. An overview of vacations and holidays can be found here.

###### ECTS-points
All courses are measured by the anticipated workload of the individual course and DTU uses the ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) method. One year of full-time studies is worth 60 ECTS points.

ECTS points are allocated to each course to determine the anticipated time each student is expected to spend on that course. The number of hours includes time spent on attending classes as well as time spent on preparation and on any reports, examinations etc. A good estimate is that 4 hours of class means that you have to prepare 4-5 hours in advance to keep up during the classes.

1 ECTS-point corresponds to app. 28 hours of work. Therefore it is expected of you that you during a 5-point course in the 13-week-period use around 9-10 hours a week on that specific course.

Most courses at DTU has a work load of 5 or 10 ECTS points. This corresponds to 4 and 8 hours of scheduled classes a week in the 13-week-period respectively. The 3-week-periods in January and June are usually 5 ECTS points, which can translate to full-time.

###### Courses
Around 1.200 courses are offered to the students – all courses are within the technical-scientific field. DTU’s departments offer the courses, and although some departments offer more courses to specific study programs, the individual study program always consist of courses from several different departments.

As a BSc student you can choose from all BSc and MSc courses, while as a BEng student you may choose freely among the courses approved in your program specifications. MSc students can choose freely from all MSc courses. The program specifications are the rules that apply to your study program and include the courses you must pass. All DTU programme specifications are available a www.sdb.dtu.dk.

The courses can be found at www.kurser.dtu.dk,where each course has a description. In the description you can find the type of assessment, the workload (how many ECTS-point), learning objectives, course material, and contact information for the responsible educator so you can contact him/her if you have any questions that cannot be answered by reading the course description.

In addition, the Student Planner - www.studieplan.dtu.dk - is where you must make a complete study plan.

###### Quality of courses and evaluation
At DTU we work towards ensuring a high quality of education. As part of this work, an online evaluation wis carried out after every 13-week and 3-week-period. The Study Boards (ISN) of the department offering the course will read the evaluations. Half of the members of the Study Board are students, which ensures that students are being heard and that problems in a course are followed up. To ensure the highest quality of the courses, it is important that all students participate in the evaluations so that the answers represent the actual experience of the course.

## Module structure

During the 13-week-period, a module structure is followed with two or three modules each day. Each module is divided into 4 hours separated by a one hour break (see the table below).

There are five schematic groups a week with two modules a day - with the exception of Tuesday where there is also an evening module. The schematic groups each have a number, which can be seen below. The distribution of numbers may seem a bit confusing, but like everything else at DTU, it is part of a well-considered system. The distribution of numbers ensures that a 10-point course has classes twice a week. One in the morning and one in the afternoon. In addition, there is a minimum of two days between two different classes. This means that you as a student will have time to prepare in-between the classes.

The exception to this system is schema group 5, which is on Wednesdays. This schema group has been created for courses that last for a whole day. For example, it may be an advantage when you have to do time-consuming experiments.

Each module has a letter in addition to a number, where the first half of the week is called A and the other half B.

5-point courses only fill half a schema group (one module a week).

In addition, the letters E stands for autumn (efterår) and F stands for spring (forår). For example, if a course is placed in “E2”, it means that the course is worth 10-ETCS-points and it is in schema group 2, during autumn, and the course will take place Monday from 1 pm - 5 pm and Thursday from 8 am to 12 am. Similarly, F5A is a spring course worth 5 ETCS-points and it is placed Wednesday morning.

## The Student Minister

Jørgen Bo Christensen is the Student Minister at DTU. He is employed by Lundtofte church but his office is at DTU Lyngby Campus. If you have any personal problems, you can talk to the minister. You can talk to him individually or with a few other students in a student group. If you want to help arrange a lecture you are more than welcome to contact the minister.

In 1970, DTU decided to hire a minister to talk to the students about their problems. The minister offers help and offer guidance if you have any kind of problems. The conversations can be about heartbreak, grief, loneliness, identity crisis, faith, anxiety or depression. No problem is too small, and you do not have to be religious to seek help from the minister. The conversations can vary from a one-time-session to a 3-months long program.

Together with Anita B. Bennetsen (who is also a minister) they offer a grief counselling group and a group for people with stress.

Furthermore, the minister offers a room for praying for any student who would like to use it regardless of faith.

## Student Counselling

This is where you can seek social, psychological and psychiatric counselling if you experience issues that interfere with your ability to reach your potential as a student—such as academic issues, social issues, or psychological issues e.g. exam anxiety, loneliness, stress. The service is confidential, free of charge, and staffed by psychologists, social workers with psychotherapeutic training, and psychiatric specialist physicians.

They have offices on the 1st floor in building 101E at Lyngby Campus, where the same psychologist is there everytime. Here you can have conversations with the psychologist privately 1 on 1 on Fridays, but remember to book an appointment (by telephone).

## Welfare

DTU has a responsible education and working environment where your well-being and openness is an priority. All activities on DTU is based on a respectful collaboration between students and employees. This is DTU’s expectation to all students and employees.
