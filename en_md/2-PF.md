# 2 Polyteknisk Forening

##### The student association

Polyteknisk Forening - commonly abbreviated PF - is the student association of DTU. PF is involved in most of the parts of being an student. You can split the association up in three parts– the academical, the political, and the social. Volunteer students in each part of PF decide the path and the policies of the association. In the following, you can read about the three different parts of PF, what PF does for the students of DTU and how you can become a part of PF.

## Introduction

Polyteknisk Forening is an association for the students and by the students. This means that no matter your interest, PF is there for you. The association is being run by students who volunteer to engage both politically, academically and socially.

PF is more than 170-years-old, which makes it the eldest student association in Denmark. PF’s main purpose is to represent all students of DTU. The association works on a national scale to better all conditions for students. This includes education, study environment, social events, living conditions, and much more. It is also PF who arranges the introduction day, rustrips, Introduction Week etc. for you and your fellow students. It is us who have improved the public transport between Lyngby and Ballerup campus. It is us who fights for your interests on a local plan as well as on a national plan, like on The People’s Democratic Festival on Bornholm. The best part of it is, that you can become a part of this association on exactly the level you want to - as a part of the student councils, as a volunteer at PF events, as a part of a PF committee, or just as a regular member strengthening our association. At the secretariat on either Lyngby or Ballerup Campus you can talk to one of the PF board members, or get help to join PF or The Danish society of engineers (IDA), borrow meeting rooms, get a form about our accident insurance, and much more.

## Academical

PF works towards ensuring and improving the quality of all DTU’s study programs. We represent the students inside the university’s important governing bodies, but also informally working to ensure the quality of the engineering education is at its highest.

On the academic front, PF works to ensure all study programs are of the highest quality. This is partly done through Study Boards (ISN) where every course evaluation from the Departments is looked through by students and the faculty to find possible improvements. We collaborate with the Executive Board at DTU and the Office for Study Programs and Student Affairs to find the best ways to improve the teaching methods, exam methods and summer courses on DTU. Often based on discussion from the Academic Committee.

In addition, PF organizes academic events like workshops and talks. These might include various topics like economics, innovation and entrepreneurships as well as presentations from technological personalities.

## Social

PF works to ensure and evolve the students’ study environment and house/living conditions. We have the responsibility for S-Huset, which is a gathering place for all students and is used for various social events.

On the social front, PF works towards ensuring a good and safe study environment. This includes both deciding whether the facilities and the classrooms meet our standards, if the food in the cafeteria is good enough, and if there is study room/booths to study in silence. PF also works with topics like livelihood for students, SU, stress, and shortage of housing.

PF organizes a lot of social events like running events, a ski trip, a surfcamp, football tournaments, and large concerts – so you will not be bored while studying on DTU. In your everyday life you can drop by S-Huset where you can play games, enjoy your lunch, have a meet-up with coffee, or drink a beer after a long day of classes.

In S-Huset, PF has created good study places for concentration.

## Political

Through student politics, PF has the opportunity to influence decisions which affect education and the study environment on DTU. We try to make sure the students voices are being heard, both locally and nationally.

PF stood to organize a panel debate in connection with the election.

PF organizes panel debates with politicians to put relevant topics on the agenda – we also invite them to DTU during elections. We partake in the People’s Democratic  Festival on Bornholm and organize large thematic events to give the students the opportunities to speak their mind about subject like SU, the intensity of studies, and educational reforms. Our committes determines PF’s stance on more narrow matters, e.g. the 2% cuts is tackled by the Political Group.

Furthermore we ensure the students voices are being heard on DTU by electing representatives to the Board of DTU and other DTU committees. In PF we are actively involved with  education policies   on all levels – from discussions about the set-up of individual courses and a better study environment on DTU both inside and outside the classrooms , to deeper discussions about the structure of the engineering education and long-term strategies for DTU.

PF is in all regards independent of party politics and religion, whether it is university law, competence of teaching, study environment, or housing policies.

## Student Councils

A student council is a collection of students who represents their study programs’ interests. All study programs have a council, and if you are interested in becoming a part of this community, the opportunities are endless.

The student councils are established through PF and most of them meet once a month. They discuss relevant topics within the council’s academic, political and social interests. Each council ensures that the relevant study programs’ opinions are expressed. The student councils discuss academically relevant subjects such as business visits, research presentations and whether courses can be improved or changed for the better. The student councils also arrange social events for the members in the council and for all students within the councils’ study programs. There are different traditions for each student council, but these events may include Christmas parties, annual cabin trips, and barbeque nights.

The study councils provide a great opportunity to expand your social and professional network. You will get to know other students from your study program, not necessarily only from the same year as you. You can also meet people from other councils. In addition, it is fun being a part of a student council - typically you eat together before the meeting, and afterwards you may end with a soda or a beer in Kælderbaren (KB).

By joining the student council you have the opportunity to learn more about what goes on at DTU, and to make a difference for your study program, whether you think student politics is the best of the best, or that it could be fun to host a social event. The meetings are always open and nonbinding. Everyone is welcome to come and share their opinions.

## Join PF

Does PF sound like something for you? Read all about how to become a member below.

Becoming a member of PF is one of the best ways you can support the association and the voice of the students at DTU. Furthermore, there are multiple benefits only available to our members. For example, you get a discount on tickets to our concerts (the so-called Joints), you get access to a number of discounts in shops in and around Copenhagen and Lyngby, and you can get a cup of coffee and a muffin in S-Huset on a discount.

The price for a membership for PF is a one-off payment that is determined by how many years your study is, whether you have been on a rustrip, and if you have signed up in one of our budget periods. As a rule of thumb, the membership costs 50 kr. pr. semester.

If you have questions regarding the membership or how to sign up, please stop by our secretariat at Lyngby or Ballerup Campus. Here you can also get a PF-sticker for your student ID, which is proof that you are in fact a member and gives you access to the discounts.
